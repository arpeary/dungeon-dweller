Dive into adventure as you delve into a seemingly endless quest for treasure and 
combat through randomly created ascii dungeons and combat. Defeat monsters randomly 
placed in a randomly picked dungeon level to earn gold and find the key that opens
the door to the shop. There spend gold to better yourself to face the ever enduring
monster horde!
