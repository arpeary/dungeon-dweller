###### Description
Dive into adventure as you delve into a seemingly endless quest for treasure and 
combat through randomly created ascii dungeons and combat. Defeat monsters randomly 
placed in a randomly picked dungeon level to earn gold and find the key that opens
the door to the shop. There spend gold to better yourself to face the ever enduring
monster horde! 
###### Synopsis
Made after a semester's worth of python, relies havily on reading and writing to files, 
while taking advantage of dictionaries that are proceduraly created based on the map, 
or image that needs to be displayed based on the games logic. Also uses same dictionary 
action in order to display the console output in a neat border with relevant toolbar 
information. Special thanks for Peyton's work on the movement logic and Jared's work on 
shop logic and project documentation.
